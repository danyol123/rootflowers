            <th>Hometown</th>
            <td>I was raised in a town called Pontianak in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. It's a pretty small town with nothing much going on, just a couple of malls and lots of trees. What I love about Pontianak, however, is the food. It's home to some of the most delicious food I've ever eaten. Lots of kwetiau goreng, kwecap, chaikue. hekeng, nasi borobudur, nasi campur, and more!</td>

        <tr>
            <th>Achievement</th>
            <td>One of my greatest achievement is being in the top 10 in my school. I've never considered myself to be someone who cares about rankings, but in recent years I met some new friends that sparked back my competitive spirit and pushed me to study harder and improve. In the end, I managed to reach the top 10, not as good as my other friends but for me it's an achievement that I'm very proud of.</td>

        <tr>
            <th>Favourite</th>
            <td>One of the things I really enjoy are board games. I love learning the rules and mechanics of board games to the point that I binge watch board game tutorials out of pure curiosity without even having the game. I often go out with my friends to board game cafes to try out games and have a fun time with my friends. It's more fun talking and playing with your friends in person rather than through the screen.</td>
