              <td>I'm from Indonesia, more specifically in the city called Pontianak, located in West Kalimantan. It's considered as a small city but I love it there regardless, what makes it special for me is the community and the wide spread of food types there is, it's quite underrated so I recommend you to visit it if you have the chance and try out the food there!</td>

              <td>I like hanging around with friends, playing games with them. But my personal favourite whenever I get the time and mood to is, to read something, like a book, and to me it's a relaxing thing I like to do whenever I feel lost or need something to keep my mind off of something or to gain knowledge of things I'm uncertain on.</td>
