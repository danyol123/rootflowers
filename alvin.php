                        local Sarawakian! 🌴
                        Bintulu may be a small town, but it’s full of warm people and mouth-watering foods. My hometown
                        embraces a rich mix of cultures — Malays, Ibans, Chinese, and Indians — living together
                        harmoniously.
                        Some of the delicious local dishes I’d recommend include Kampua, Laksa, Kuehcap, Belacan Mee
                        Hoon, and Chah Kueh Tiao 🍜😋</td>

                        actively involved in the school basketball program.
                        Through consistent training and teamwork, I learned the importance of discipline, communication,
                        and perseverance.
                        Representing the school in friendly matches and local tournaments strengthened not only my
                        skills but also my confidence and leadership.
                        Basketball taught me that teamwork and dedication can turn challenges into achievements. 🏆🔥

                        I’m a huge basketball lover and often spend 2–3 hours per day training. 🏀💪
                        Besides that, I enjoy listening to music and playing board games with friends. 🎶🎲
                        That’s all about me — simple, passionate, and always ready to improve! 😊</td>
